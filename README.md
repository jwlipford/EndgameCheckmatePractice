# Endgame Checkmate Practice
### Practice checkmating when your opponent has only one king

This app for Windows lets you practice the end of a chess game in which you have two or more pieces left and the opponent has only his king. At the start of a new game, you choose to control from two to eight pieces, which are then placed randomly on the board. You must figure out how to checkmate the opponent's king (if possible) without stalemating.

All standard pieces are included except the Pawn. Additionally, five nonstandard "fairy pieces" are included. This means that ten total types of pieces are included: the standard King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, and Knight; and the nonstandard Mann, Wazir, Ferz, Wizard, and Champion.

Two informational documents are included: "How to Play" and "Recommended Piece Sets," the latter of which recommends sets of pieces with which to start the game. The opponent's king moves randomly, except that it captures unprotected pieces when possible, meaning you can checkmate even when, theoretically, you do not have enough material to force checkmate. The board has a warm brown color.
